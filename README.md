<h2>What is SV's Simple Counter?</h2>
It is a simple PHP counter that counts your website visitors. It has the ability to 
either show the count as plain text, or images; and whether or not to count only 
unique hits, or all hits. (IP Based)

PHP 5.4 is currently required due to the use of PHP 5.4+ features. It is a work in progress.

<h2>Installation</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Open 'counter.php', configure the settings near the top of the script.</li>
	<li>Create a new folder, named 'counter'.</li>
	<li>Upload 'counter.php', 'index.html', and the 'logs' directory in ASCII mode.</li>
	<li>Upload the 'images' folder in BINARY mode.</li>
	<li>CHMOD the 'counter.txt' and 'ips.txt' files to 0666 (if required). They are located in the 'logs' folder.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Usage</h2>
Simply add the following code to the page where you want the counter to be shown:<br />
<code><?php include './counter/counter.php'; ?></code>
<br />
<br />
That's pretty much it, really.
