# Simple Counter - A simple web hit counter.

[Simple Counter](http://github.com/ericsizemore/simple_counter/) is a simple PHP counter that counts your website visitors. It has the ability to 
either show the count as plain text or images; and whether to count only unique hits, or all hits. (IP Based)

# WARNING

* The code in this branch (`6.x-dev`) is a development branch for the upcoming v6.0.0, a complete rewrite of this library.
* There are many things that still need updated.

It is NOT recommended to use this code in production.

## Important Note

* As of v6.0.0, Simple Counter is no longer licensed under the GNU LGPLv3 license.
* v6.0.0 is a complete rewrite of the library, and no GNU LGPLv3 licensed code remains.
* v5.0.1 and previous are still licensed under the GNU LGPLv3 license.

With that being said, it is important to read the `Upgrading` section below if you are coming from an older version.


## Acknowledgements

The icons used for the default image set (0-9 'png' images found in `counter/images/`) are licensed under the [CC BY 4.0 DEED license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), and were designed by [StreamlineHQ](https://www.streamlinehq.com/freebies/typeface).


## Upgrading

Pre-v6 -> v6 is not a simple upgrade. Several things have changed in this rewrite, and there are breaking changes.

Please read [UPGRADING.md](UPGRADING.md) first before attempting an upgrade.


## Installation

To install Simple Counter, first install via composer:

```bash
composer require esi/simple_counter:^6.0
```

There are several options defined by default, however you will likely run into issues if you do not change some of them.
More information can be found in [Usage](#usage) below.

* Copy the `counter` directory from `vendor/esi/simple_counter` to your webroot
  * The `counter` directory contains the `logs` and `images` directory.
  * You can change the name of either directory if you wish, or skip using the `counter` directory all together and just move `logs` and `images` to your webroot.
    * However:
      * The ip file and counter file must remain `ips.json` and `counter.json`
      * The images must be named 0-9.
* Make sure the `ips.json` and `counter.json` files within your logs directory are writable.


## Usage

**More detailed documentation is a work in progress.**

Usage is fairly simple once installed. There is currently one option for the type of counter you wish to use, and that is the `JsonFileAdapter`. A `DatabaseAdapter` is slated for an upcoming release.

Simply add the following code to the page where you want the counter to be shown:

```php
<?php

// Load the composer autoload file, if not already loaded
require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Esi\SimpleCounter\Counter;
use Esi\SimpleCounter\Adapter\JsonFileAdapter;
use Esi\SimpleCounter\Configuration\JsonFileConfiguration;

/**
 * $options is an array of:
 *
 * array{
 *     logDir: string,
 *     countFile: string,
 *     ipFile: string,
 *     imageDir: string,
 *     imageExt: string,
 *     uniqueOnly: bool,
 *     asImage: bool
 * }
 *
 * Default values are:
 *
 * [
 *      'logDir'     => dirname(__DIR__, 2) . '/counter/logs/',
 *      'countFile'  => 'counter.json',
 *      'ipFile'     => 'ips.json',
 *      'imageDir'   => dirname(__DIR__, 2) . '/counter/images/',
 *      'imageExt'   => '.png',
 *      'uniqueOnly' => true,
 *      'asImage'    => false,
 * ] 
 */
// Valid options are:
$options = [
    'logDir'     => '/path/to/some/dir/logs',
    'countFile'  => 'counter.json',
    'ipFile'     => 'ips.json',
    'imageDir'   => '/path/to/some/dir/images',
    'imageExt'   => '.png', // '.png', '.jpg' etc. default images are PNG images
    'asImage'    => true,   // true = images, false = plain text
    'uniqueOnly' => true    // true = counts only unique ip's, false = counts all
];

/**
 * When creating the counter instance, an Adapter with a valid Configuration is required.
 * Currently, Simple Counter ships with one Adapter and it's corresponding Configuration:
 *
 * \Esi\SimpleCounter\Adapter\JsonFileAdapter
 * \Esi\SimpleCounter\Configuration\JsonFileConfiguration
 *
 * \Esi\SimpleCounter\Counter can be used as a wrapper, but it is not necessary. For example:
 *
 * $counter = new Counter(
 *     new JsonFileAdapter(
 *         new JsonFileConfiguration($options)
 *     )
 * );
 */
// Pass custom options
$counter = new JsonFileAdapter(
    new JsonFileConfiguration($options)
);

// ... or if you wish to use defaults
$counter = new JsonFileAdapter(
    new JsonFileConfiguration()
);

// ... or maybe you only want to switch to using images, for example
$counter = new JsonFileAdapter(
    new JsonFileConfiguration(['asImage' => true])
);

// Finally, call display(). You can either output it directly or save it to a variable if needed
echo $counter->display();

// ... or ...

$hitCount = $counter->display();

// ... do some stuff
echo $hitCount;

?>
```


## Handling Errors

Simple Counter uses Exceptions for various issues that may arise throughout its process.

Currently, most exceptions fall under `\Symfony\Component\OptionsResolver\Exception\InvalidOptionsException`.

These exceptions can be thrown if:

* You pass an option that is not defined.
* A given options value type does not match the allowed types.
* When reading/writing to a file encounters an error, since it is likely due to a file name/location issue.
* For invalid directories or files, in terms of `logDir`, `imageDir`, `countFile`, `ipFile`


## About

### Requirements

- Simple Counter works with PHP 8.2.0 or above.

### Submitting bugs and feature requests

Bugs and feature requests are tracked on [GitHub](https://github.com/ericsizemore/simple_counter/issues)

Issues are the quickest way to report a bug. If you find a bug or documentation error, please check the following first:

* That there is not an Issue already open concerning the bug
* That the issue has not already been addressed (within closed Issues, for example)

### Contributing

Simple Counter accepts contributions of code and documentation from the community. These contributions can be made in the form of Issues or [Pull Requests](http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/) on the [Simple Counter repository](https://github.com/ericsizemore/simple_counter).

Simple Counter is licensed under the MIT license. When submitting new features or patches to Simple Counter, you are giving permission to license those features or patches under the MIT license.

Simple Counter tries to adhere to PHPStan level 9 with strict rules and bleeding edge. Please ensure any contributions do as well.

#### Guidelines

Before we look into how, here are the guidelines. If your Pull Requests fail to pass these guidelines it will be declined, and you will need to re-submit when youâ€™ve made the changes. This might sound a bit tough, but it is required for me to maintain quality of the code-base.

#### PHP Style

Please ensure all new contributions match the [PSR-12](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/) coding style guide. The project is not fully PSR-12 compatible, yet; however, to ensure the easiest transition to the coding guidelines, I would like to go ahead and request that any contributions follow them.

#### Documentation

If you change anything that requires a change to documentation then you will need to add it. New methods, parameters, changing default values, adding constants, etc. are all things that will require a change to documentation. The change-log must also be updated for every change. Also, PHPDoc blocks must be maintained.

##### Documenting functions/variables (PHPDoc)

Please ensure all new contributions adhere to:

* [PSR-5 PHPDoc](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/proposed/phpdoc.md)
* [PSR-19 PHPDoc Tags](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/proposed/phpdoc-tags.md)

when documenting new functions, or changing existing documentation.

#### Branching

One thing at a time: A pull request should only contain one change. That does not mean only one commit, but one change - however many commits it took. The reason for this is that if you change X and Y but send a pull request for both at the same time, we might really want X but disagree with Y, meaning we cannot merge the request. Using the Git-Flow branching model you can create new branches for both of these features and send two requests.
