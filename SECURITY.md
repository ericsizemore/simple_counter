## Reporting a Vulnerability

If there are any vulnerabilities discovered within **simple_counter**, please do not hesitate to _report them_. 

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/ericsizemore/simple_counter/security/advisories/new) tab. If you have a fix for the issue, that is most welcome -- please attach or summarize it in your message!

I will evaluate the vulnerability and, if necessary, release a fix or mitigating steps to address it. I will contact you to let you know the outcome, and will credit you in the report.

   Please **do not disclose the vulnerability publicly** until a fix is released!

Once either a) a fix has been published, or b) I have declined to address the vulnerability for whatever reason, you are free to publicly disclose it.
